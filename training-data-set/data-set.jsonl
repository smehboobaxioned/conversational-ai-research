Adding/connecting/configuring of new ‘Accounts’ and/or ‘Ad Accounts’ with Supermetrics will be managed by Max (for Facebook/Meta). We’ll extract the values through the Supermetrics API as JSON, and pull them into a database (so that we don’t call their API every single time). We could refresh these daily or every x frequency. If there are factors due to which we can’t get the API access (eg: too high per request costs) then we can do with a manual Excel/CSV upload.\n- **UX/UI:** UX: We’ll create some mockups (inspired of course by what’s been shared with us till date) with the objective of making the beta testers experience as smooth as possible within the applicable constraints. UI: To go for a well-rounded look and feel without investing a lot of time in UI designs, we’ll leverage an available design systems/token - which can be adequately customized to match the brand colors (Style Guide).\n- **Forecasting and calculations:** For Forecasting, we’ll look to use an Exponential Smoothing (ETS) algorithm similar to derive similar outcomes as the FORECAST.ETS in Excel for Office 365. As outlined in the Excel demo, we’d use standard deviation with a value of T to establish different levels of threshold. Minimum of 7/14 days and maximum of 31 days of data used to forecast.\n- **Others:** We might add a basic level of authentication on the page so that only folks with the password (your beta testers) can access this. Campaigns can be grouped into ‘Campaign Groups’, with each campaign potentially having different Objective metric. The Dashboard can be filtered by Accounts and Campaign Groups, with an overview of affected KPIs, severity and outcome. Similarly, there’d be Spend Alerts on this screen which would be derived based on Objective and associated actual data we receive. Reporting screen will allow drill-down and filter by Campaign Groups and/or specific Campaigns.\n\n## Client Deliverables and Dependencies\n- Supermetrics API access and licensing.\n- Hosting environment (AWS Amplify or Vercel).\n- Setup/connection of necessary on Supermetrics.\n- Brand Colors / Style Guide feedback.\n- Feedback on typography, UX/UI content, and design system tweaks.\n- Feedback on presented mockups, preview links, and demos.\n\n## Costs\n<chatbot to include the details>\n\n## Out-of-Scope Activities\n- GitHub OR BitBucket SVN set-up (Axioned can set this up at no additional cost).\n- Any maintenance related activities (separate Maintenance Agreement can be provided).\n- 3rd-party software licenses, and/or plugin costs.\n- Any activities not explicitly detailed as in scope within the above items."}]}

The key objectives include:\n- Designing immersive and user-friendly UX/UI interfaces tailored for iOS and Android devices, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing experience for users.\n- Implementing advanced functionalities such as secure user authentication, real-time session updates, personalized push notifications, and multimedia content delivery to enhance app usability and engagement.\n- Integrating comprehensive event-related content, including session details, speaker profiles, venue information, and multimedia resources, to provide users with valuable and relevant event insights.\n- Conducting rigorous QA/testing processes to validate app functionality, usability, performance, security, and cross-platform compatibility, ensuring a seamless user experience across diverse devices and operating systems.\n- Incorporating feedback from user acceptance testing (UAT) and iterative development cycles to refine app features, address user pain points, and enhance overall user satisfaction.\n- Successfully deploying and launching the app on major app stores, utilizing effective app store optimization (ASO) strategies to maximize app visibility, downloads, and user adoption rates.\n\n## Timeline\nThe project will be executed in four distinct phases, each spanning a designated timeframe:\n- Phase 1: Design (Weeks 1-2)\n- Phase 2: Development + Content Population + QA/Testing (Weeks 3-10)\n- Phase 3: Feedback Incorporation (Weeks 11-12)\n- Phase 4: Deployment and Launch (Weeks 13-16)\n\n## In-Scope Activities\n\n### Phase 1: Design (Weeks 1-2)\nDuring this initial phase, our dedicated design team will focus on creating intuitive and visually captivating UX/UI interfaces tailored specifically for iOS and Android platforms. Leveraging industry-standard design tools such as Sketch and Adobe XD, our designers will craft wireframes, prototypes, and mockups, ensuring alignment with project goals and user expectations.\n\n### Phase 2: Development + Content Population + QA/Testing (Weeks 3-10)\nThis phase will involve multifaceted activities, including:\n- Development: Our skilled development team will utilize Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android to build the core features of the mobile app, such as user authentication, session management, and reservation booking. Advanced functionalities, including real-time data updates and push notifications, will be implemented using robust APIs and SDKs.\n- Content Population: The app will be populated with comprehensive event-related content provided by the client, including session agendas, speaker biographies, venue details, and multimedia resources. Our team will ensure seamless integration and organization of content to enhance user accessibility and engagement.\n- QA/Testing: Thorough QA/testing procedures will be conducted using industry-leading tools such as TestFlight and Firebase Test Lab. Our QA specialists will rigorously assess app functionality, usability, performance, security, and compatibility, identifying and resolving any issues or deficiencies to ensure a flawless user experience.\n\n### Phase 3: Feedback Incorporation (Weeks 11-12)\nDuring this critical phase, feedback from UAT and stakeholder reviews will be meticulously analyzed and incorporated into the app through iterative development cycles. Our agile development approach enables rapid adaptation and refinement of app features based on user input and stakeholder feedback, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with project objectives.\n\n### Phase 4: Deployment and Launch (Weeks 13-16)\nThe final phase will focus on preparing the app for deployment and launching it on major app stores, including the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
